The Best Brownies

About This Recipe
"These brownies are not cake-like. They are more moist and gooey. I always undercook them a bit because we like them very moist."

Ingredients
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 large eggs
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/3 cup cocoa powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup flour

Directions
Preheat oven to 350Â°.
Mix oil and sugar until well blended.
Add eggs and vanilla; stir just until blended.
Mix all dry ingredients in a separate bowl.
Stir dry ingredients into the oil/sugar mixture.
Pour into greased 9 x 9 square pan.
Bake for 20 minutes or until sides just start to pull away from the pan.
Cool completely before cutting.
Note: I usually double the recipe and bake in a 9 x 13 pan. If you double the recipe, you will need to cook longer than 20 minutes.
